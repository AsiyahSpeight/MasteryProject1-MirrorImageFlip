Course number and section: CPSC-231-01
Assignment or exercise number: MP1 - Mirror Flipping Images

ERRORS 
- errors were in the syntax of some lines of code, LLM (chatgpt), was used in order to fix the syntax problems, and troubleshoot. The prompts were stated clearly as to not add any irrelevant code, and only fixed what need to be fixed.

- ran into issues in terms of compiling and running the java script, due to docker not being on, or not responding. I had to restart my laptop a few times in order for it to start and attach properly.

- methods were tested as I coded to ensure good syntax and understanding.

SOURCES
A list of all references used to complete the assignment, including peers (if applicable)
My classmate Kevin Orpeza assisted me in how to start (mainly in syntax), 
LLM ChatGPT, was used as a guide to ensure the code ran smoothly with no issues. Gemini was attempted, but didn't give the best results as ChatGPT did, therefore it was not referenced in my code as I did not use any of the suggestions it gave me. Lecture material was used as a guide.
